.. admonition:: Contributors wanted

    Please keep in mind that this package including all source code and documentation
    is developed and maintained by a single person. I am investing a large amount of
    time into maintaining projects like this in order to supply the most intuitive, yet
    powerful and high-level API as possible.

    **Any collaborative contributions, especially improvements and fixes are appreciated
    and should be inquired via an issue at the** `GitHub Repository`_.
