Aeros_ is a production-grade ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) package
containing wrappers for widely used Web and API functions.

.. admonition:: Contributors wanted

    Please keep in mind that this package including all source code and documentation
    is developed and maintained by a single person. I am investing a large amount of
    time into maintaining this project in order to supply the most intuitive, yet powerful
    high-level API possible.

    **Any collaborative contributions, especially improvements and fixes are appreciated
    and should be inquired via an issue at the** `GitLab Repository`_.
